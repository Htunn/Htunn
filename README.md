## About Me

Technology practitioner with over a decade of experience at the intersection of cloud computing, security, and data engineering. I specialize in transforming cutting-edge research into practical business solutions, with a focus on implementing AI/ML systems that provide genuine value while maintaining security and reliability at scale.

My journey spans from traditional operations to modern engineering-focused approaches, where I've successfully led cross-functional teams in implementing secure DevSecOps practices and architecting resilient multi-cloud solutions that balance technical innovation with business agility.

## Core Expertise

### DevSecOps & Security Engineering
- "Shift-left" security methodologies with 60%+ reduction in mean-time-to-remediation
- Automated security testing integration in CI/CD pipelines (SBOM, SCA, SAST, DAST)
- Vulnerability management strategies and security team collaboration frameworks
- Security frameworks and compliance (OWASP, CIS, NIST, IM8)
- Cloud Security implementations (CSPM, CWPP, CNAPP, ZTNA, SASE)

### Multi-Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure
- Strategic multi-cloud environments preventing vendor lock-in
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)
- Container orchestration and service mesh architectures (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cross-provider cost optimization and technical resilience strategies
- Enterprise cloud migration and modernization initiatives

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Production AI/ML systems from research to deployment
- Large Language Models (LLMs) implementation and fine-tuning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture design
- Azure OpenAI Service integration and custom solutions
- MLOps pipelines and AI model security/governance frameworks
- Computer vision and natural language processing applications

### Data Engineering & Site Reliability
- Petabyte-scale data pipeline architecture and ETL processes
- Data quality frameworks and governance implementations
- SRE practices with SLOs, error budgets, and automated reliability testing
- Observable systems design and performance optimization
- Engineering-focused approach to operational challenges

### Identity & Access Management
- Modern identity governance and zero-trust architecture
- Authentication innovations and passwordless implementations
- Enterprise IAM solutions balancing security with user experience
- Access management for complex distributed systems

## Key Achievements

- **DevSecOps Transformation**: Implemented "security as code" methodologies that reduced mean-time-to-remediation by over 60% through automated security testing and team collaboration frameworks
- **Multi-Cloud Architecture**: Designed and deployed enterprise multi-cloud environments with strategic flexibility, preventing vendor lock-in while optimizing costs across AWS and Azure
- **AI/ML Production Systems**: Successfully transformed AI research into practical business applications, implementing production-ready machine learning systems with proper governance and security
- **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Architected and implemented petabyte-scale data processing systems with robust ETL processes and data quality frameworks
- **SRE Implementation**: Established Site Reliability Engineering practices with SLOs, error budgets, and automated reliability testing, transforming system performance measurement and improvement
- **Identity Modernization**: Led enterprise IAM implementations with zero-trust architecture and passwordless authentication, balancing security with seamless user experience


## Featured Projects

### [Agentic LLM Web Search](https://github.com/Htunn/agentic-llm-search)
An intelligent agent that combines local LLM inference with web search capabilities to provide well-researched answers with proper citations. Optimized for Python 3.12 with TinyLlama and GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon M-series chips.

### [Agentic IoT Observability](https://github.com/Htunn/agentic-iot-observability)
Complete observability solution for IoT devices, collecting temperature and humidity metrics, storing them in MongoDB, visualizing them in Grafana, and enabling natural language queries through an LLM (Llama) service.


## Professional Focus & Knowledge Sharing

I am passionate about staying at the forefront of modern technology landscapes, particularly where AI, cloud computing, and security intersect. Through my [blog "Tech With Htunn"](https://blog.htunnthuthu.com/), I share practical, experience-based guidance that goes beyond theoretical conceptsâ€”real approaches that have succeeded (and sometimes failed) in production environments.

My knowledge-sharing focuses on:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Moving beyond the hype to implement AI solutions that deliver genuine business value
- **DevSecOps**: Practical implementations of security as code, not afterthought
- **Data Engineering**: Architecting for insight with robust data pipeline strategies
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Achieving strategic flexibility while minimizing complexity
- **Modern IAM**: Identity as the new security perimeter in distributed systems
- **Site Reliability**: Stability through engineering principles and automation

I actively contribute to open-source projects, participate in technology communities, and regularly update my knowledge base with emerging practices and lessons learned from real-world implementations.

## Connect & Collaborate

I'm always eager to connect with fellow technology practitioners, share experiences, and explore collaborative opportunities. Whether you're looking to discuss industry trends, seek guidance on specific technical challenges, or explore potential partnerships, feel free to reach out.
