## 👨‍💻 About Me

Technology practitioner with over a decade of experience at the intersection of cloud computing, security, and data engineering. I specialize in transforming cutting-edge research into practical business solutions, with a focus on implementing AI/ML systems that provide genuine value while maintaining security and reliability at scale.

My journey spans from traditional operations to modern engineering-focused approaches, where I've successfully led cross-functional teams in implementing secure DevSecOps practices and architecting resilient multi-cloud solutions that balance technical innovation with business agility.

## 🎯 Core Expertise

### 🔒 DevSecOps & Security Engineering
- "Shift-left" security methodologies with 60%+ reduction in mean-time-to-remediation
- Automated security testing integration in CI/CD pipelines (SBOM, SCA, SAST, DAST)
- Vulnerability management strategies and security team collaboration frameworks
- Security frameworks and compliance (OWASP, CIS, NIST, IM8)
- Cloud Security implementations (CSPM, CWPP, CNAPP, ZTNA, SASE)

### ☁️ Multi-Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure
- Strategic multi-cloud environments preventing vendor lock-in
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)
- Container orchestration and service mesh architectures (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cross-provider cost optimization and technical resilience strategies
- Enterprise cloud migration and modernization initiatives

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Production AI/ML systems from research to deployment
- Large Language Models (LLMs) implementation and fine-tuning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture design
- Azure OpenAI Service integration and custom solutions
- MLOps pipelines and AI model security/governance frameworks
- Computer vision and natural language processing applications

### 📊 Data Engineering & Site Reliability
- Petabyte-scale data pipeline architecture and ETL processes
- Data quality frameworks and governance implementations
- SRE practices with SLOs, error budgets, and automated reliability testing
- Observable systems design and performance optimization
- Engineering-focused approach to operational challenges

### 🔐 Identity & Access Management
- Modern identity governance and zero-trust architecture
- Authentication innovations and passwordless implementations
- Enterprise IAM solutions balancing security with user experience
- Access management for complex distributed systems

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- **DevSecOps Transformation**: Implemented "security as code" methodologies that reduced mean-time-to-remediation by over 60% through automated security testing and team collaboration frameworks
- **Multi-Cloud Architecture**: Designed and deployed enterprise multi-cloud environments with strategic flexibility, preventing vendor lock-in while optimizing costs across AWS and Azure
- **AI/ML Production Systems**: Successfully transformed AI research into practical business applications, implementing production-ready machine learning systems with proper governance and security
- **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Architected and implemented petabyte-scale data processing systems with robust ETL processes and data quality frameworks
- **SRE Implementation**: Established Site Reliability Engineering practices with SLOs, error budgets, and automated reliability testing, transforming system performance measurement and improvement
- **Identity Modernization**: Led enterprise IAM implementations with zero-trust architecture and passwordless authentication, balancing security with seamless user experience


## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Agentic LLM Web Search](https://github.com/Htunn/agentic-llm-search)
An intelligent agent that combines local LLM inference with web search capabilities to provide well-researched answers with proper citations. Optimized for Python 3.12 with TinyLlama and GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon M-series chips.

### [Agentic IoT Observability](https://github.com/Htunn/agentic-iot-observability)
Complete observability solution for IoT devices, collecting temperature and humidity metrics, storing them in MongoDB, visualizing them in Grafana, and enabling natural language queries through an LLM (Llama) service.


## 📚 Professional Focus & Knowledge Sharing

I am passionate about staying at the forefront of modern technology landscapes, particularly where AI, cloud computing, and security intersect. Through my [blog "Tech With Htunn"](https://blog.htunnthuthu.com/), I share practical, experience-based guidance that goes beyond theoretical concepts—real approaches that have succeeded (and sometimes failed) in production environments.

My knowledge-sharing focuses on:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Moving beyond the hype to implement AI solutions that deliver genuine business value
- **DevSecOps**: Practical implementations of security as code, not afterthought
- **Data Engineering**: Architecting for insight with robust data pipeline strategies
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Achieving strategic flexibility while minimizing complexity
- **Modern IAM**: Identity as the new security perimeter in distributed systems
- **Site Reliability**: Stability through engineering principles and automation

I actively contribute to open-source projects, participate in technology communities, and regularly update my knowledge base with emerging practices and lessons learned from real-world implementations.
