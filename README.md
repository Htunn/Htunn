## 👨‍💻 About Me

Technology practitioner with over a decade of experience at the intersection of cloud computing, security, platform engineering, and data engineering. I specialize in transforming cutting-edge research into practical business solutions, with a focus on implementing AI/ML systems and platform engineering solutions that provide genuine value while maintaining security and reliability at scale.

My journey spans from traditional operations to modern engineering-focused approaches, where I've successfully led cross-functional teams in implementing secure DevSecOps practices, building internal developer platforms, and architecting resilient multi-cloud solutions that balance technical innovation with business agility.

Passionate about open source, I actively contribute to security and infrastructure testing communities through projects like [ansible-inspec](https://github.com/Htunn/ansible-inspec) (combining Ansible automation with Chef InSpec compliance testing), [simple-port-checker](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-port-checker), and security testing tools including [simple-exploit](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-exploit) and [simple-waf-scanner](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-waf-scanner).

## 🎯 Core Expertise

## 📚 Professional Focus & Knowledge Sharing

I am passionate about staying at the forefront of modern technology landscapes, particularly where AI, cloud computing, and security intersect. Through my [blog "Tech With Htunn"](https://blog.htunnthuthu.com/), I share practical, experience-based guidance that goes beyond theoretical concepts—real approaches that have succeeded (and sometimes failed) in production environments.

My knowledge-sharing focuses on:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Moving beyond the hype to implement AI solutions that deliver genuine business value
- **DevSecOps**: Practical implementations of security as code, not afterthought
- **Platform Engineering**: Building internal developer platforms that enhance productivity and developer experience
- **Data Engineering**: Architecting for insight with robust data pipeline strategies
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Achieving strategic flexibility while minimizing complexity
- **Modern IAM**: Identity as the new security perimeter in distributed systems
- **Site Reliability**: Stability through engineering principles and automation

### Open Source & Community Dedication

I am deeply committed to advancing the security and infrastructure automation communities through active open-source contributions. My projects bridge practical security testing with modern automation frameworks:

- **[ansible-inspec](https://github.com/Htunn/ansible-inspec)**: Pioneering the integration of Ansible's automation capabilities with Chef InSpec's compliance framework, enabling organizations to combine configuration management with continuous security testing
- **[simple-port-checker](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-port-checker)**: Comprehensive network security validation tool for detecting firewall configurations and Layer 7 protection services (WAF, CDN)
- **[simple-exploit](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-exploit)**: AI-powered penetration testing framework demonstrating the intersection of modern AI/ML with ethical security testing
- **[simple-waf-scanner](https://github.com/Htunn/simple-waf-scanner)**: Advanced WAF detection and authorized security testing toolkit built in Rust for performance and reliability

Through these projects and active participation in technology communities, I share battle-tested approaches, collaborate with security professionals worldwide, and contribute to raising the bar for infrastructure security and automation practices.
